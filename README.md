# Edging-Machines
This repository is intended to contain as much information as possible about building, designing, prototyping, and using automated edging machines. 

An edging machine is a device that is intended to sexually stimulate a user until they are very close to climax which is when the device will stop (or slow down) the stimulation to prevent climax. See [Edging](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Edging) for more info.
