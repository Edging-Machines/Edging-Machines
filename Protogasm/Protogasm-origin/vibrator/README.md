The "handle.STL" and "head.STL" are the main parts of the vibrator, ready for
3D printing.

The vibrator is made from a Mabuchi RS-555PH motor, with an eccentric mass
pressed onto the shaft. These can be purchased pre-assembled, or built from the
motor and some .88" to 1" diameter cylindrical brass stock.

The vibrator case is compatible with attachments designed for the Hitachi Magic
Wand. The motor is press-fit or glued into the two halves of the case.

* Print the parts.
* Install an eccentric weight on the motor's shaft.
* Solder or crimp wires to the motor.
* Pull wires through the small hole in the side of the housing.
* Press firmly to assemble.
